#Chapter 1 Guide to HTMl

##Tools We'll Use in the Course

In this guide I walk through the tools that we'll use in this course, including a discussion on what IDEs and Text Editors are best for HTML/CSS Development. I also examine the Espresso editor that I will use for demonstration purposes.

Before we begin learning HTML and CSS, let us go through some of the tools that we'll be using for this course.

The tool I'll be using in this course is called Espresso, and it looks like this.

I like this tool because it allows me to type in HTML code, and whenever I want to see how it looks in the browser, all that I have to do is click on the Preview icon in top left corner. This opens a browser and shows the real-time view of whatever I'm working on.  You also have the choice to keep your editor and browser side by side, so every time you make a change and hit save, the change is instantly visible in the browser.

However, this is a paid tool, so I won't say you absolutely need it for this course.  A free option that I like is sublime text.  Here, you can create a HTML file, add code and save it to a particular location. To see it on the browser, open your HTML file on your browser.  This free option doesn't offer real-time editing though.  Every time you make a change, you'll have to refresh the browser to see your changes.

Besides these two tools, you can use other editors too such as Text Wrangler and Visual Studio, though I wouldn't recommend Visual Studio simply because it comes with a ton of built-ins that can be quite confusing.  Notepad ++ is a good choice too, if you're using PC. It completely depends on what you like and feel comfortable. During the rest of this course, I'll be doing HTML demos on Espresso, but feel free to pick your tool.
