#Chapter 7 Project: Create an HTML Email Template

##HTML Email Project Overview and Instructions

This guide gives an overview of the project to build along with instructions on how to accomplish the features.

In this section, we're going to build a HTML email. So far, we've cloned Google and Pinterest pages, and now we're going to see how to create HTML-friendly emails.
There will be many situations when you want to create a custom email that showcases your client's products or makes certain announcements to their end customers.  The rules for creating HTML emails are slightly different though. Here, you can't create external stylesheets, rather you have to encapsulate all your styles within the email itself.

That said, I want you to try this project by yourself before looking at the solution.  Focus on creating an email that uses a HTML image as the background,  and has text and links.

It doesn't have to be identical to this

but ensure that it contains different elements to make it interesting for you.
